#Weather Microservice

The weather microservice is a Python based microservice that can provide the weather and some details along with it.

This microservice is able to obtain the temperature, humidity, and description for a specified location. 
Furthermore it works over a socket request, allowing it to hold multiple reauests at the same time.

To utilize this service, obtain the code and an API key for the openweathermap and your local machines IP address, 
and subsitute it into the API key portion of the code and the HOST portion of the code, if the sample key is not working. 
Furthermore run the client program allowing for it to be set up on a port on the local machine and then run the client side.
After running these text should pop up in the console for a location, where a city can be entered, thus returning the details.
